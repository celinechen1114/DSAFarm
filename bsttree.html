      <h2>What is a BST tree? </h2>
      
      <p>A binary search tree (BST) is data structure that starts with a single node. Each node in this tree points to 2 "child" nodes, which contain "child" nodes of their own. The left "child" must have a value smaller than its "parent" node and the right "child" must have a larger value. This means for every node in the tree, all nodes to the left of it are smaller than it and all nodes to the right are larger than it.
        
       </p>
      <p> Node: a point that contains a key and a value (ex: numbers, strings, etc.) and points to other nodes like it.</p>

     <h2>Game Instructions </h2>
    <p> Insert an animal with an assigned number and watch our game sort the animals with the smaller number on the left node and the larger number on the right node. Press remove to watch what happens when you remove a node in the tree. Press find to see how algorithms can search through a tree. </p>
